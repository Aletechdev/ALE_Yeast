# Decides — locally, in ~1 minute — whether `snpeff_cache` can be an `az://` directory,
# instead of finding out inside an Azure Batch head job after a long queue wait.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN QUESTION
#   snpeff_cache is a directory param. Three separate operations must succeed, and they
#   fail for different reasons — this script reports them separately:
#
#     1. file('az://…/snpeff_cache').exists()       — does a virtual prefix "exist"?
#     2. .isDirectory()                             — KNOWN false on this account: HNS is
#                                                     disabled, so there are no directory
#                                                     objects. The pipeline already skips
#                                                     this guard for cloud paths (6e47b38),
#                                                     so a false here is NOT a blocker.
#     3. Channel.fromPath(…, checkIfExists: true)   — the real risk, and what
#        + staging the whole tree into a task          annotation_cache_initialisation does.
#
#   Only #3 decides it. #2 is expected to fail and is already worked around.
#
# Needs the SP secret in the environment (never on disk in this repo):
#   read -rs AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET && export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
#   ./09_test_az_dir_param.sh 2>&1 | tee "logs/09_$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).log"

AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET is not set. This is a setup step, not a failure.

`read -rs` reads silently and keeps the secret out of your shell history.

❌ SILENT FAILURE — the run "succeeded" but staged ZERO files.

   This is the dangerous case, and the reason this script counts files rather than
   trusting the exit code: SnpEff would run against an EMPTY cache and either fail
   obscurely or emit wrong annotations, with nothing in the log pointing here.

   Mechanism: AzPath.isDirectory() is false for a virtual prefix, so Nextflow treats
   the path as a single blob, finds none, and stages an empty placeholder. No error
   is raised at any layer.

   Note this is NOT a listing problem — Channel.fromPath('<prefix>/**') enumerates
   the blobs correctly. It is specifically directory-as-a-path-input staging.

   Fix: tarball + untar for snpeff_cache, mirroring UNTAR_CHR_DIR in
   subworkflows/local/prepare_genome/main.nf. Protocol-agnostic; removes the class.
