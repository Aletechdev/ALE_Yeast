#
# 🚨 WHY THE PARAMS BOX REPEATS THE PROFILE.
#
# Platform's launch form populates its parameter fields from `paramsText` ONLY. Values that
# a config profile sets are applied at runtime but are INVISIBLE in the form — verified on
# run 2eiGBEA0NXagap, where the profile's input/fasta/tools took effect yet appeared nowhere
# in the submitted params. Someone opening the launch page saw an empty input box and had to
# go read the profile to know what would run. That is the UX this trades against.
#
# So the box carries the full param set, GENERATED from the profile by `--generate` rather
# than hand-copied: `nextflow config -profile docker,<profile>` diffed against
# `-profile docker` is exactly the set of keys the profile sets. A normal run re-derives it
# and ABORTS if the committed file has drifted, so the two cannot silently diverge.
#
# ⚠️ CONSEQUENCE, accepted deliberately: `-params-file` beats config, so a Launchpad run is
#    now driven by this box, not by the profile. Changing a param means editing the profile,
#    re-running `--generate`, committing, and applying it with `--update` (in place, since
#    2026-10-05; until then every change was a re-registration with a NEW pipeline id). The
#    profile remains the single source of truth and is what local runs and nf-test actually use.
#
# 🚨 WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A UI CLICK-THROUGH.
#
# A Launchpad entry does NOT reference the repo — it stores a COPY of whatever was typed
# into its boxes. The previous entry was created by hand on 2026-08-07 and still carried
# params naming a file that no longer exists; nothing warned anyone, and nothing ever
# re-read the repo. Keeping the box contents in
# launchpad_params_ottilie_test_az.yml and applying them from here makes that copy
# reproducible and reviewable, instead of living only in a browser field.
#
# ⚠️ A RUN WITHOUT A FLAG REPLACES THE ENTRY and mints a NEW pipeline id: `tw pipelines update`
#    returns HTTP 500 on 0.38.0, `versions manage` only renames, and `import --overwrite`
#    reports "New pipeline added" with a changed id (all tested 2026-08-12). Nothing in this
#    repo depends on the id (only RUNBOOK.md records it), but a bookmarked Launchpad URL breaks.
#
#    `--update` (2026-10-05) changes the params box and keeps the id. `PUT /pipelines/{id}`
#    returns 200 when `launch` carries `computeEnvId` and the other launch fields as GET gives
#    them. Measured on the entry `yAMP_copy`: same pipeline id, revision, profiles, compute
#    environment and engine pin; Platform stores the change as a new default VERSION of the
#    entry (`<version name>-1`) with a new version hash. The 2026-08-12 attempts got HTTP 400
#    sending the GET object back as it was, which holds a `computeEnv` object and no
#    `computeEnvId` (the likely reason; the 400 was not reproduced).
#
# WHAT LIVES WHERE, and why it is split:
#
#   conf/test/ottilie_test_az.config   the PROFILE — the single source of truth. Input,
#                                      reference, tools, joint-germline settings, and a
#                                      timestamped outdir. What local runs and nf-test use.
#   launchpad_params_ottilie_test_az.yml
#                                      the BOX — GENERATED from that profile, carrying the
#                                      full param set so the launch form is populated. It
#                                      overrides the profile at launch, which is why it is
#                                      generated and drift-checked rather than hand-written.
#
# ⚠️ The profile is only as current as the REGISTERED REVISION on GitHub. Platform clones
#    it; your working tree is invisible. Push before launching, always.
