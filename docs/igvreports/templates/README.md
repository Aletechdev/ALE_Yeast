# yAMP mutation report: the `index.html.j2` contract

`index.html.j2` is the template of the mutation report's `index.html`, rendered by `../generate_index.py` (process `GENERATE_INDEX`). Tabulator 6.3 is inlined from `vendor/`, the data is injected as JSON; one offline HTML file, no CDN. The design was handed over on 2026-10-06 as `report.html.j2`, restyled to the agreed mockup (`Mutation Report.dc.html` in the design project), and adapted here. This file is the contract between the renderer and the template: the context below is what `template_context()` builds.

## How it is rendered
1. `generate_index.py` loads the MultiQC tables, the prepared cohort VCF and the CN / SV CSVs as before (`build_context()`), then maps them onto the context below (`template_context()`), and renders with `autoescape=True` (the template marks the inlined Tabulator files `| safe` and injects data with `| tojson`).
2. `summary_data[].breadth_20x_pct` comes from MultiQC general stats (`mosdepth-20_x_pc`, a whole percent); no extra process input.
3. `qc_thresholds` are the `params.report_qc_*` values, written by the module to `qc_thresholds.json` (`--qc-thresholds`); `QC_THRESHOLD_DEFAULTS` in the script apply to a standalone render. `cn_thresholds` are the script's constants, shared with its Summary counts.
4. The per-sample IGV locus URL (`igv_locus_template`, `?locus=chrom:pos`) is handled by `custom_template_sample.html`; the link is shown only for non-reference genotypes.
5. A render needs no network; `load_web_fonts` stays `False` (decided 2026-10-06).
6. Methods holds the eight sections of the previous template's Methodology after *QC thresholds*. Keep the *SV event matrix* section in sync with `docs/variant-calling/sv_merge.md` (a Jinja comment says so).
7. `SNV_TABLE_MAX_ROWS` is 1000; the renderer passes `counts.snv_listed` / `snv_coding` / `snv_all` / `snv_max_rows`, `snv_single_sample` and `snv_has_ann`, so the page prints the full numbers and says when the table is cut. Since 2026-10-07 every PASS row ships, each with `differs`; the rows sort differing first, so a cut costs shared rows before differing ones.

Set `snv_rows` / `sv_rows` to `None` (and leave all three CN lists empty) to hide a section. Section numbers and nav update to match.

## What changed vs the template before 2026-10-06
- **Header:** run line plus a provenance block (commit, Nextflow/Seqera, session, output path with a Copy button, the report bundle's folder when it differs). The theme toggle and dark mode are gone (it's a light document style now).
- **Sticky section nav.**
- **Summary:** a ruled count table instead of cards, built in JS from the rows. The Samples row shows how many samples failed QC or have warnings, with a reason line for each failure. This replaces the separate failure banner.
- **Samples:** a QC status column. Pass/warn/fail colouring comes from `qc_thresholds`, which are also shown under each header. A sample below `cohort_cov_frac` × the cohort median coverage gets a warning. Mapped reads (M) and CNVKit events are kept (informational, not graded).
- **SNV / InDel:** Locus is a single column (sorts by chromosome order, then position). VAF cells also show depth, in amber below `min_dp`. Clicking a row opens a per-sample panel (GT, AD, DP, VAF, IGV link at that locus). The view toggles show counts; since 2026-10-07 a cohort has three: *Protein-changing* (opening view), *All differing*, *All PASS sites* (every PASS row: the shared strain background and the carried sites with no sample to compare against, whose other cells read *no reads*). An *IGV, all samples* button opens the cohort igv-report. Three wordings as before: cohort with SnpEff, cohort without SnpEff (no gene columns, no Protein-changing toggle, opens on the differing sites with a *Differ between samples* / *All PASS sites* toggle), one sample (every PASS site it carries; *Protein-changing* / *All PASS sites*). When the rows were cut at `snv_max_rows` the lede says so and the toggles read "N of M". The *CSV, rows shown* export carries a hidden *Differs between samples* column on a cohort.
- **SV:** the Type / Location / Length layout. New "Differ between samples" toggle.
- **Copy number:** the three tabs are gone.
  - *Whole chromosomes:* samples as rows. A source toggle switches between TIDDIT (incl. Mito) and CNVKit.
  - *Changed windows:* one row per window that changed in any sample, plus a per-sample strip (values shown up to 8 samples, compact blocks with hover above that). Chromosome chips and a "hide changed in every sample" toggle.
  - The Fold change / log2 ratio toggle and "Only samples with a change" apply to both tables.
  - Downloads: TIDDIT CSV, CNVKit CSV, Windows CSV and *All bins CSV* (the uncollapsed matrix, `data/cn_cohort_full.csv`).
- **Methods:** the QC thresholds text is generated from `qc_thresholds`; the eight sections of the old Methodology follow it (filter tables, counting pipeline, SV merge, CNVKit, TIDDIT contig CN, IGV report generation, Samples table sources), with *Card counts* and *Tabs* rewritten for the new page.
- The Seqera iframe download hint is kept.

## Presentation mode (tutorials, screen sharing, slide screenshots)
- Turn it on with `report.html?present`, the **Present ⤢** link in the nav, or the **P** key (P again exits). It keeps the current `#section`.
- **Text:** larger type throughout and a wider page (max 1600 px).
- **Tables:** all at full height with every row drawn (`renderVertical: "basic"`), so a full-page or "Capture node screenshot" gets the whole table.
- **Hidden:** downloads, the copy button and the Seqera hints. The nav stops being sticky.
- **Window strip:** shows values for up to 12 samples (8 in normal mode).
- **Deep links:** use one per tutorial step, e.g. `report.html?present#cn-chr`, `#cn-win`, `#snv`. The page scrolls there after the tables render.
- **Slide captures:** set the browser window to 1600×900 at 100–125 % zoom.

## Checks
- Render with the two-sample test run (the e2e contract test does; `index.html` is name-only in its snapshot, so open the page in a browser).
- Render a run with ≥ 60 samples. Check that the window strip switches to compact blocks and the chromosome table gets a fixed height and scrolls.
- Force a QC failure (e.g. `cov_fail=50`). The Summary should show the failure line, and that sample's QC cell should be red.
