# Publish the ottilie e2e test-data to Azure Blob in BOTH shapes, behind a stable PUBLIC (no-SAS) URL:
#   1. ottilie_test_data.tar.gz   — one atomic bundle for local onboarding / CI (download-then-run)
#   2. files/**                   — the individual file/folder tree for Seqera/Batch per-file staging
#   3. snpeff_cache.tar.gz        — cache-only tarball; Seqera fallback when a snpeff_cache *directory*
#                                   won't stage cleanly from a URL (point --snpeff_cache at the untarred dir)
#   4. SHA256SUMS                 — covers the individual files AND both tarballs, so a consumer can prove
#                                   the tarball unpacks to exactly the individual set (they never drift)
#   5. samplesheet_test_blob.csv  — samplesheet whose fastq_1/fastq_2 are the public per-file URLs (Seqera)
#   6. README.md                  — what the data IS: sample↔FASTQ↔SRA mapping, the truth set, and the
#                                   reference-pairing rule. Shipped INSIDE the bundle and published
#                                   standalone. Source of truth is bundle_README.md, next to this script.
#   7. download_pilot_fastq.sh    — the 4-sample pilot RECIPE (reads stay on SRA; see blob_layout.md for
#                                   why the pilot data itself is not re-hosted). In the bundle and standalone.
#   8. pilot_truth_set.csv        — the paper's published events for the pilot clones (Sup Data 4 + 5), keyed
#      sample_name_dictionary.csv   by pipeline sample names; and the clone-name dictionary that reconciles
#                                   the paper's tables with SRA. Both tracked in git under data/ottilie/.
#
# BOTH REFERENCES ARE PUBLISHED, and both go in the bundle:
#   S288C_reference_test/   slimmed — chromosomes I, IV, VII, XV. Pairs with the 2-sample test reads.
#   S288C_reference/        full    — all 16 + Mito. Needed by the 4-sample SRA set, and usable with
#                                     the 2-sample reads for a truer (but not truth-set-comparable) run.
# The full reference costs only ~27 MB compressed (84 MB on disk — it is nearly all text), which is
# ~7% on a 373 MB bundle. Cheap enough that shipping one bundle beats shipping two and having someone
# pair the wrong reference with the wrong reads. ⚠️ Reads set a MINIMUM reference: bigger is always
# allowed, smaller never is — 4-sample reads against the slim reference MISMAP rather than fail.
# See bundle_README.md.
#
# Content is PRJNA590203 (public SRA) + public S288C reference/annotation → safe to be world-readable;
# the URL is stable, unauthenticated, and needs no SAS to distribute or rotate. See DATA_PROVENANCE.md.
#
# PROVISIONING IS OWNED BY infra/azure/ — the storage account + public 'releases' container (publicAccess
# 'blob') are created by infra/azure/deploy.sh from the ARM template. THIS script only UPLOADS content;
# it never creates or re-permissions the container (so it can't flip the deployed 'blob' access level).
#
# Requires: az CLI (`az login`), a populated data/ottilie/, tar, sha256sum, md5sum. Uploads use
# shared-key auth (AUTH=key) — works with control-plane access + the account's allowSharedKeyAccess=true,
# no data-plane RBAC role needed. Set AUTH=login to use AAD instead (needs a Storage Blob Data role).
#
# ⚠️ ottilie/v1 IS A ROLLING PREFIX — re-running this republishes it IN PLACE, and every consumer
#    picks the change up with no repointing. That is deliberate: an update parked under a new prefix
#    reaches nobody until something is edited to point at it. Additive changes (new files, a bigger
#    bundle) are safe. REMOVING or RENAMING a published file is not — bump PREFIX for that.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   bash docs/benchmarking/ottilie_xenobiotic_ale/01_data_retrieval/release/publish_test_data.sh
# Override target (a breaking change needing a new version, or a different host):
#   ACCOUNT=aletestdatapublic CONTAINER=releases PREFIX=ottilie/v2  bash .../publish_test_data.sh
# Build everything locally and upload NOTHING (no az needed; stage dir is kept for inspection):
#   DRY_RUN=1 bash .../publish_test_data.sh

# THE PREFIX IS ROLLING, NOT IMMUTABLE: ottilie/v1 is updated in place, so every consumer picks up

#                         republished in the same run, so download_test_data.sh stays consistent —
#                         but anything holding an OLD hash out-of-band will now mismatch.
#
# ⚠️ BUMP THE PREFIX (PREFIX=ottilie/v2) for a change that would BREAK a consumer — removing or

#    is additive and safe; taking things away is not.

# hop be re-verified. A manifest at the blob root cannot do that once the files have moved.
#
# ⚠️ NOT one per published file. chr_dir and snpeff_cache are consumed as DIRECTORY params, so a
